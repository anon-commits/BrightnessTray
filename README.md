Use your mouse/scroll wheel!

### Optional Customisation!

- Show a static icon in the tray with the `/NoTextIcon` launch parameter
- Hide the brightness text label in the fly-out window with the `/NoPercentageText` launch parameter
- Customise the tray icon text colours using `BrightnessTray.ini` using either color name strings or ARGB format (0-255 values)

```
[icon]
foreground = Red
background = 0,0,0,0
[lighticon]
foreground = Red
background = Black

```

- (The `lighticon` block is used if you are using the light taskbar theme of Windows 10 1903)
